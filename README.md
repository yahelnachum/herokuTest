The theme I chose was very simple. Its got a basic 3 color scheme 
with just small variations on the same color. The darkest color 
was chosen as the background while the lightest color was the 
list and the third color inbetween the two is used to manipulate 
the list through filtering, adding, or deleting. The minimalistic 
colors scheme gives it a nice trendy flat look that is in style 
right now. The curved corners give the panels more interesting shape 
to them than just flat rectangles. 

One technical achievement that I have implemented is that filtering a 
list will change the url and the url can be shared and used with 
another person to send them the exact filtered list that you have created.
